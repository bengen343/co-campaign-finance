<p>
This repository contains two Python notebooks for downloading Colorado Secretry of State data and turning it into a usable BigQuery database. One notebook for Colorado campaign finance data and one for Colorado election results. The election result data I'm interested is manually downloaded and available in the `/results` folder.
